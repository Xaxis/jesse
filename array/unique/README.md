### Code Challenge: uniq
One of the fundamental cornerstones of any programming language is having
a firm grasp on arrays and how to manipulate them. This first challenge
will get you started by developing a common utility function that is often
included in many array manipulation libraries.

#### The Challenge

Write a function named `uniq`. `uniq` should produce a duplicate-free version of the array.
Running the `unique` function should return the given array free of duplicates.

````
def unique(array)
    # Your code goes here
````

The function would be used like the following example demonstrates:

````
print(unique([1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3]))
[1, 2, 4, 3]
````

Note that no libraries of any kind should be used for this challenge.
